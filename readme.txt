As I was not required to do the user creation part, I'm skipping to login.

There are 3 users registerd in my database table a user, a premium user (puser) and an admin.
As user creation is not required for the task, I'm also not encrypting the password it'll be stored as it is in the table.
Neither I'm making an interface to change these Login credentials.

The premium page on user page is a dummy page, and as it was not required for the task I'm skipping its working.

Need to add database
Need to add users to table

Need to fix login validation.
