# image-album
A web application for creating/managing images as albums.


As I was not required to do the user creation part, I'm skipping to login.

There are 3 users registerd in my database table a user, a premium user (puser) and an admin.
The respective email and password are:

user@user.com
user

puser@puser.com
puser

admin@admin.com
admin


As user creation is not required for the task, I'm also not encrypting the password it'll be stored as it is in the table.
Neither I'm making an interface to change these Login credentials.

The premium page on user page is a dummy page, and as it was not required for the task I'm skipping its working.

Overall project is not complete.

Work in progress.
